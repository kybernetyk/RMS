hfloader - C based hotfile.com downloader
dlscripts - old shell based hf downloader
mcp/mcp.cs - manages downloads from rslinks.org, makes sure nothing is downloaded twice
mcp/Program.cs - mkv->mov converter for apple tv. only transcodes audio, if necessary, not video.
		requires: mkvtoolnix, mp4box, ffmpeg

for hfloader to work you will need a .hfloaderrc file in your home dir
	which contains your HF login credentials:

username=<your username>
password=<password>


mcp requires you to add tv series you like to a file called 'addseries'.
the content is links to the _full season_ of a tv series, delimited by \n
mcp will parse these, ignore all files that are already listed on the page
by adding them to 'downloaded', and adding content from addseries -> series.
this is to avoid downloading all episodes that you probably have watched by
now.

mcp will have to be run as a cronjob.
