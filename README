hfloader - C based hotfile.com downloader
dlscripts - old shell based hf downloader
mcp/fetchURLs.cs - manages downloads from rslinks.org, fetches all hotfiles URLs, makes sure nothing is downloaded twice
		- see mcp/series for a sample file
mcp/mkv2mov.cs - mkv->mov converter for apple tv. only transcodes audio, if necessary, not video.
		requires: mkvtoolnix, mp4box, ffmpeg
mcp/rssfeeder.cs - download rslink.org's rss file, and search for patterns of words in title, to automatically add new download sources (eg new season)
		- see mcp/matchlist for a sample file

for hfloader to work you will need a .hfloaderrc file in your home dir
	which contains your HF login credentials:

username=<your username>
password=<password>


mcp requires you to add tv series you like to a file called 'addseries'.
the content is links to the _full season_ of a tv series, delimited by \n
mcp will parse these, ignore all files that are already listed on the page
by adding them to 'downloaded', and adding content from addseries -> series.
this is to avoid downloading all episodes that you probably have watched by
now.

mcp will have to be run as a cronjob.


autounrar - java -jar auto-unrar-1.0.jar -l
		= win. remember to edit conf/bla.properties



Sample configuration (in case I forget it myself, as this is truly open source, and thus sucks / is horrible to use):

	1. Create an "addseries" file.
		Inside this place links to FULL seasons. Eg: http://www.rslinks.org/tv-series/v-season-2-720p-hdtv-x264
		Seperate these by newlines.

	2. Run 'mono fetchURLs.exe'
		This will make sure that all hotfile links found there will be added to the 'downloaded' list.
		!!! delete the file 'downloadplox' !!!

	3. If you want to automatically watch for new series or seasons, create a file called 'matchlist'
		Delimiter for different series is newline
		This is case sensitive (it makes sense, yes it does)
		"+" requires a word to be in the title
		"-" requires a word to not be in the title
		
		Example: "+V  +Season -dvdrip" will require: "V " AND "Season", but "dvdrip" must not be in the title.

	4. Set up autounrar/conf to your needs.

	5. Configure unrar.sh
		This script calls the auto unrar methods.
		It can move downloaded files after extraction to a different location (eg: a network share)
		It's also there to call mkv2mov, if you have an ï£¿ TV or other reasons to hate .mkv

	6. cronjob recommendations:
		rssfeeder: every 59m
		fetchURLs: every 29m
		downloader: every 31m
		unrar: every 60m

	Random numbers are random.
